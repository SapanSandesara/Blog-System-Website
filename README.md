# BlogSystemWebsite

I made this website for one of assignments in master of software development program at Victoria University of Wellington.

The application is made using PHP, HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. MySQL database is used to store and retrieve information about users, blogs and comments.

Screenshots of the website:
